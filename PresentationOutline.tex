%I created this as its own page so we could discuss the presentation and what we plan to do in it.
%We will begin with an introduction, and then we'll discuss the zeta and M\"{o}bius functions, but beyond that I am still unclear about what topics we specifically will cover.
%I will put up our names here, and then everyone will fill in the topics they plan to cover for the presentation


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Sammy: Introduction to Posets, with more examples and as few definitions as possible (still need to decide which ones)

%William:

%Andy:

%We should also decide on a time to meet for a practice or two before the presentation itself. I propose that we meet at the latest on the night of Tuesday, december 18, 2012 at the University of Minnesota, but we may want to meet earlier.
